    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Naruto Ichiraku Ramen (ラーメン一楽): Ichiraku's Ramen is Naruto Uzumaki's favorite food. 
        He eats it almost always and usually stops by Ichiraku's dining establishment between missions and he is often joined by Iruka Umino, his sensei. 
        Because Naruto has been a loyal customer for most of his life, Teuchi and his daughter, Ayame, were among the few people in Konoha not to treat Naruto with animosity during his youth.
