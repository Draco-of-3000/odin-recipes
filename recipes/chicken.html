        Looking for KFC chicken but wanna make that deliciousness by yourself? Congratulations you're in the right place!
        They said it couldn’t be done—but dare we say our homemade version of KFC™ fried chicken is better than the original recipe? 
        We start with a flavorful combination of 11 spices you already have in your pantry and combined them with flour and brown sugar to create the makings of that savory KFC™ crunch you crave. 
        After that, it doesn’t get any easier than dredging the chicken and frying it up in hot oil. If you’ve ever wondered how to make KFC™ chicken, the secret is here.

        <li>Fry chicken in batches. Breasts and wings should take 12-14 minutes, and legs and thighs will need a few more minutes. Chicken pieces are done when a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F.</li>

    <strong>More About This Recipe</strong>
    <p>Nobody knows the exact spice mix used in the classic KFC™ chicken recipe, but we think this version is pretty close. It uses herbs and spices you probably have on hand if you have a fairly stocked pantry. 
       The spice mix will look like a lot of seasoning for one batch of fried chicken, but keep in mind that those spices will be mixed with flour, so the spices will lose some of their kick. 
       It might seem strange to add brown sugar to the flour mixture since this is a savory recipe, but just that tiny bit of sweetness really balances out the spices with the chicken. 
       Many fried chicken recipes will ask you to double-bread the chicken, and while we are fans of that method, the classic KFC™ version has a thinner crust, so you only need to bread once. 
       Egg whites are just right for dipping the chicken in before coating. They give the flour mixture something to stick to without being too thick.
